  bio: "I'm a Digital Media student at UCF majoring in Interactive Web & Marketing. Over the past couple years, I've developed extensive technical skills to enhance my abilities as both a developer and creative designer. Starting with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've expanded my knowledge to include more advanced frameworks like React Native for creating interactive experiences. My expertise extends to both client-side and server-side development, including command line operations with Bash and PuTTy, Git version control, npm package management, and backend frameworks like PHP and Node.js. This comprehensive skill set allows me to bridge the gap between technical implementation and creative design, resulting in compelling digital experiences.",
  interests: "When I'm not coding, I channel my creative energy into music production and brand design. I enjoy illustrating and developing story concepts for music projects, album artwork, and brand identity. I'm also an outdoor enthusiast and avid gamer. I stay current with emerging technology trends, particularly in AI and digital media, continuously seeking ways to integrate these innovations into my creative and technical work."
